# Hardcoded Product

## Context 
This shop will list exactly one item for sale.

## Decision
The product price, description and so on should be hardcoded into the shop page

## Benefits
- no need for a product database or product search functionality

## Consequences
- can only edit the product by editing the static html
- introducing product variants or options later will be more work
